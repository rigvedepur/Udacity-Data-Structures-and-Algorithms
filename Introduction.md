# Introduction

If the function input is proportional to number of lines of code to run, its called a linear relationship

Some functions have quadratic relationships too. For example, a nested for-loop (one for loop inside of another) can be quadratic

### Order
Rate of increase of an algorithmn

<b>Big O Notation: O(n)</b> - Represents the rate of increase or order during the run-time of algorithm in terms of input size (n)
